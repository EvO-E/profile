This is all the parts of my roaming profile that are safe to share.

To set it up, run the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/ssokolow/profile.git ~/.profile_repo
    ~/.profile_repo/install.py --dry-run
    [ Make any adjustments you want ]
    ~/.profile_repo/install.py

Because $HOME/.git and the .git folder inside a repository are different
things, you can't just clone it into your home directory.

install.py handles symlinking things in a quick and orderly fashion.

In the future, I may also include some kind of function to pull in all the
utilities and apps I need on, at least, Debian-based Linux distros.
