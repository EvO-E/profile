- Once I've got my crontab being backed up in this repo, add a nightly removal
  of ~/.xsession-errors since I tend to stay logged in for weeks and don't want
  it to grow huge with pointless DEBUG messages and harmless GTK+ theme errors.

- install.py needs some mechanism for calling setup scripts so I can pull
  non-ancient npm automatically.
- install.py should also handle setting up git submodules.
- Add a commit hook to verify that I haven't accidentally committed my GitHub
  token or SMTP credentials or my Geeqie last-visited folder.
- I should see if I can set up some kind of git post-clone hook for setting up
  submodules in every project I clone.
- Decide how to integrate a zsh chsh call to whatever global setup I design.
- Re-port my custom zsh prompt back to bash and include in .zsh_profile.
- Figure out a good way to sync settings containing passwords like:
  - My complete .gitconfig (SMTP credentials and GitHub token)
  - Audacious (scrobbler password and not ideal for Git but possibly)
  - Pidgin (many account passwords)
  - Thunderbird (just plain not suited to Git.)
  - Firefox (just plain not suited to Git. I'll probably have to wait for Addon Sync)
- I need a more automatic way to build virtualenvs for my projects without
  having to sync the virtualenvs themselves.
  - Find or make an "addvirtualenv <project> [virtualenv]"  command for
    virtualenvwrapper which creates and attaches a virtualenv for an existing
    project and then runs `pip install -r requirements.txt` and/or
    `./setup.py develop` (in that order) if they exist. (All other options are
    passed to mkvirtualenv so you can use things like -i and -r and bare
    virtualenv arguments.
  - Decide on the most appropriate approach to automating the calling of said
    command on many projects.
- I need some kind of automatic mechanism for generating an equivs definition
  from the in-repo pulseaudio and pulseaudio-utils metadata and then calling
  equivs-build and dpkg -i on it to ensure future installs don't pull them in.
- recently-used.xbel can't be a symlink. It must be a genuine directory to
  circumvent GTK+'s attempt to maintain the MRU list.
- Figure out a way to store the folder config for Firefox Scrapbook (stored
  alongside the data in ~/incoming/ffox_scrapbook) alongside either my roaming
  profile or my Firefox profile.
- Automate the process of removing these without exploding if not present:
   appmenu-gtk3 appmenu-gtk appmenu-qt indicator-applet-appmenu indicator-appmenu
   liboverlay-scrollbar
