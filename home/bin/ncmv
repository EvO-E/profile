# Light-weight script for moving files across a network
#
# To use:
# 1. Make sure tar, netcat, and pv are installed.
# 2. Edit TARGET_IP and TARGET_PORT
# 3. Run with `--listen` on the target machine.
# 3. Run with files/folders to move as arguments on the source machine.
#
# Troubleshooting:
# - The OpenBSD version of netcat (included with Ubuntu) needs `-p` removed
#   from the listening-side `nc` command.
# - The version of netcat packaged for Slax is too old to understand the
#   `-q 0` option which makes the sending-side `nc` exit on completion.
#
# Optional modifications:
# - To copy rather than move, remove the `&& rm -rf "$@"` from the sending side
# - If you lack the "pv" command, you can remove `| pv -W` from the pipeline.
#   It's just for displaying a summarized progress indicator.
# - If you'd like your transfers to end up somewhere other than $PWD, use the
#   `-C /target/path` option to the listening-side tar command.
